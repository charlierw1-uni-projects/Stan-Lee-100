          Stanley Martin Lieber, also known as Stan Lee, was born on December
          28, 1922, in Manhattan, New York City, to Celia and Jack Lieber,
          Jewish-Romanian immigrants. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School in
          the Bronx and graduated in July 1939. Stan's career began in December
          1939 as an editing assistant for Timely Comics, which eventually
          became Marvel Comics. Stan Lee got married to Joan Clayton Boocock, a
          former hat model and actress in December 1947, and they had two
          children called: Joan Celia Lee and Jan Lee, who unfortunately died
          three days after delivery. Stan Lee worked as a producer, writer, and
          actor throughout his career, leaving a lasting mark on the comic book
          industry. In 1963, aged 40, Stan Lee announced to the world that it
          was the "Marvel Age of Comics". It was considered the most innovative
          year of Stan's life. Alongside his team of creative partners, Jack
          Kirkby, Steve Ditko, and Larry Lieber (who was also Stan's brother),
          Stan began to reinvent comics with characters who would become some of
          the most renowned superheros of today. Spiderman and the Fantastic
          Four were flourishing from the previous years and the year saw the
          creation of X-Men, The Avengers, and Doctor Strange, which proved to
          be a huge success and enforces Stan's name as arguably the best
          superhero creator of all time. Unfortunately, Stan Lee died on the
          12th November 2019, at the age of 95, in Los Angeles, California, due
          to cardiac arrest with respiratory failure and congestive heart
          failure.
